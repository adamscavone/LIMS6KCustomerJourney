# LIMS6000 Phase 1 Implementation Status

**Document Purpose:** Complete development record for a prototype web application replacing an outdated laboratory management system. This document assumes no prior knowledge of the project.

**Last Updated:** June 2, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/adamscavone/LIMS6KCustomerJourney  
**Local Path:** `c:\000repo\LIMS6KCustomerJourney`

## üìã Project Background

### What is LIMS?
**LIMS** (Laboratory Information Management System) is software that manages laboratory samples, test results, and workflows. Think of it as the central nervous system for a scientific testing lab.

### The Business Problem
Our cannabis testing laboratory currently uses **LIMS5000**, an outdated system that creates significant productivity problems:
- Scientists spend hours hunting for information across multiple systems
- Critical sample prep data lives in Excel spreadsheets outside the main system
- Due dates are misleading and don't reflect actual laboratory deadlines
- The user interface is confusing and slow
- No clear "ownership" or checkout system for samples in progress
- Customer and order information is fragmented, making communication difficult
- No early warning system for upcoming workload planning
- Workflow phases are poorly organized, causing confusion about required actions
- Content shifts unpredictably in tabular interfaces, making scanning difficult

### The Solution
Build **LIMS6000** - a modern, web-based replacement focused on how scientists actually work, with clear workflow ownership, realistic deadline management, customer-first organization that reflects natural laboratory communication patterns, and phase-based workflow management that guides analysts through different types of required actions.

## üéØ Phase 1 Objective

**Goal:** Create a working prototype of the main dashboard that laboratory scientists use daily.

**Why start here:** This dashboard is where scientists spend most of their time planning work, reviewing test results, and managing priorities. Getting this right is critical for user adoption.

**Deliverable:** A functional web application that stakeholders can use in a browser to experience the new workflow with customer-first organization, phase-based pipeline management, and early warning capabilities.

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Primary User: Dr. Sarah Chen

### Who She Is
- **Role:** Senior Chemistry Analyst
- **Experience:** 8 years in cannabis testing laboratories
- **Education:** B.S. in Chemistry, specialized certifications
- **Personality:** Detail-oriented, scientifically rigorous, frustrated by inefficient systems

### What She Does Daily
- **Morning:** Plans daily work by reviewing samples that need testing, organized by customer and order
- **Day:** Runs chemical analyses on cannabis samples (cannabinoids, terpenes, pesticides)
- **Evening:** Loads instruments for overnight testing runs
- **Next Morning:** Reviews overnight test results and makes quality control decisions
- **Customer Communication:** Provides status updates organized by customer and order context
- **Batch Management:** Organizes prep batches and commits them to analytical batches for instrument runs
- **Data Management:** Exports data from instruments and imports to LIMS (air gap closure)

### Her Current Pain Points (Why She Hates LIMS5000)
1. **Information Scattered:** Critical data is split between LIMS and Excel files
2. **Confusing Deadlines:** System shows administrative due dates, not actual lab deadlines
3. **Poor Quality Control:** Can't easily trace problems across related samples
4. **Rush Sample Chaos:** Everything shows the same deadline, making priorities unclear
5. **Workflow Confusion:** Can't tell the difference between initial tests and repeat tests
6. **No Sample Ownership:** Can't tell who is responsible for samples in progress
7. **Customer Context Lost:** Can't easily see customer-level workload or provide status updates
8. **No Early Warning:** Can't predict upcoming chemistry workload from DPM Early Start samples
9. **Phase Confusion:** All samples mixed together regardless of what type of work is needed
10. **Content Shifting:** Information moves around in tables making it hard to scan efficiently

### Her Success Criteria
If LIMS6000 works well, Dr. Chen should be able to:
- See all her work priorities in one place, organized by customer and order
- Understand real deadlines that matter to her workflow
- Quickly review test batches for quality control
- Identify and resolve testing problems efficiently
- Know who is responsible for each sample at any given time
- Provide customer-level status updates quickly
- Anticipate upcoming workload from DPM Early Start samples 2-3 days in advance
- Focus on appropriate work type based on workflow phase
- Manage analytical batches and prep batch organization effectively
- Export and import data between instruments and LIMS efficiently

## üñ•Ô∏è What We Built: Welcome Dashboard

## üîÑ Key Workflow Innovations

### Customer-First Organization System
**Core Principle:** All information organizes around the natural laboratory communication hierarchy of Customer ‚Üí Customer Order ‚Üí Individual Samples.

**How It Works:**
- Default Order View groups samples by customer orders
- Multiple orders per customer are clearly distinguished
- Customer-level priority and status aggregation
- External reporting deadlines take absolute priority
- Supports natural customer communication patterns
- Context preserved through all workflow phases

### Phase-Based Pipeline Management
**Core Innovation:** Pipeline containers subdivided by workflow phases reflecting actual work requirements and action types.

**Five Distinct Phases:**
1. **Prep Needed:** Physical preparation required (PREP REQUIRED)
2. **Ready for Batch:** Awaiting analytical batch assignment (BATCH ASSIGNMENT) 
3. **Analytical Batches:** Instrument runs with hierarchical organization (RUNNING/QUEUED)
4. **Individual Prep:** Individual sample preparation (ACTIVE)
5. **Data Ready:** Manual export needed (EXPORT NEEDED)

**Business Logic:** Transforms pipeline from simple sample list to workflow management tool that guides analysts through appropriate work types.

### Sample Checkout System
**Core Principle:** Samples are "checked out" by qualified users, reflecting real-world operations where team members take responsibility for timely processing.

**How It Works:**
- Users with qualifying Demonstrations of Capability (DoCs) can "check out" samples
- Checked out samples show clear ownership and responsibility
- Status progression: Ready for Prep ‚Üí Prep (checked out) ‚Üí Prepped ‚Üí Analysis (checked out) ‚Üí Analyzed
- Ensures samples are processed to meet ReportingNeededBy deadlines

### DPM Early Start Logic with Enhanced Customer Aggregation
**Early Warning Chemistry:** Provides advance notice of potential chemistry workload organized by customer with due date priority:
1. **Customer-Level Aggregation:** Shows total potential samples per customer that could require chemistry
2. **Due Date Priority Sorting:** Overdue customers first, then by earliest ES Due date
3. **ES Due Dates:** "Early Start Due" indicates when microbial decisions are expected
4. **Expandable Detail:** Click customer to see constituent orders and individual sample progress
5. **Priority Inheritance:** Customer-level priority based on highest priority constituent sample

**Prerequisites for Chemistry Assignment:**
1. **Passing ALL microbial assays:** Bile-Tolerant Gram Negative Bacteria, Total Yeast & Mold, Total Aerobic Bacteria, STEC, Salmonella, Total Coliforms
2. **Completing microbial primary review:** Marked as complete
3. **Completing microbial secondary review:** Marked as complete

**Result:** Qualified samples automatically have required chemistry tests added and appear in analysts' pipelines as "Ready for Prep"

### Analytical Batch Hierarchical Management
**Three-Level Structure:**
1. **Analytical Batch:** Overall instrument run with timing and status
2. **Prep Batches:** Groups of samples prepped together by specific analysts
3. **Individual Samples:** Actual customer samples with full context

**Features:**
- Expandable drill-down for batch details
- Real-time status indicators (RUNNING with pulse animation, QUEUED)
- Time tracking for start times and estimated completion
- Prep analyst assignment and sample count visibility
- Customer context preserved at sample level

### Invisible Table Architecture
**Core Innovation:** CSS Grid-based layout providing professional table appearance without visible borders.

**12-Column Structure:**
- Consistent column positioning prevents content shifting
- Due date information always appears in same location
- Priority chips have dedicated space (when present)
- Status information maintains fixed alignment
- Actions positioned consistently

**User Benefit:** Professional, scannable interface that maintains alignment regardless of content variations.

### Streamlined Priority Indicators
**Design Principle:** Standard priority is implied default, only rush samples need visual indication.

**Implementation:**
- No "Standard" priority chips displayed
- Only "Rush" samples get red priority indicators
- Chips positioned inline with sample names to save space
- Consistent across all view modes and workflow phases

**Result:** Cleaner interface with better space utilization and reduced visual noise.
