**Local Path:** `c:\000repo\LIMS6KCustomerJourney`

## üìã Project Background

### What is LIMS?
**LIMS** (Laboratory Information Management System) is software that manages laboratory samples, test results, and workflows. Think of it as the central nervous system for a scientific testing lab.

### The Business Problem
Our cannabis testing laboratory currently uses **LIMS5000**, an outdated system that creates significant productivity problems:
- Scientists spend hours hunting for information across multiple systems
- Critical sample prep data lives in Excel spreadsheets outside the main system
- Due dates are misleading and don't reflect actual laboratory deadlines
- The user interface is confusing and slow
- No clear "ownership" or checkout system for samples in progress
- Customer and order information is fragmented, making communication difficult
- No early warning system for upcoming workload planning

### The Solution
Build **LIMS6000** - a modern, web-based replacement focused on how scientists actually work, with clear workflow ownership, realistic deadline management, and customer-first organization that reflects natural laboratory communication patterns.

## üéØ Phase 1 Objective

**Goal:** Create a working prototype of the main dashboard that laboratory scientists use daily.

**Why start here:** This dashboard is where scientists spend most of their time planning work, reviewing test results, and managing priorities. Getting this right is critical for user adoption.

**Deliverable:** A functional web application that stakeholders can use in a browser to experience the new workflow with customer-first organization and early warning capabilities.

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Primary User: Dr. Sarah Chen

### Who She Is
- **Role:** Senior Chemistry Analyst
- **Experience:** 8 years in cannabis testing laboratories
- **Education:** B.S. in Chemistry, specialized certifications
- **Personality:** Detail-oriented, scientifically rigorous, frustrated by inefficient systems

### What She Does Daily
- **Morning:** Plans daily work by reviewing samples that need testing, organized by customer and order
- **Day:** Runs chemical analyses on cannabis samples (cannabinoids, terpenes, pesticides)
- **Evening:** Loads instruments for overnight testing runs
- **Next Morning:** Reviews overnight test results and makes quality control decisions
- **Customer Communication:** Provides status updates organized by customer and order context

### Her Current Pain Points (Why She Hates LIMS5000)
1. **Information Scattered:** Critical data is split between LIMS and Excel files
2. **Confusing Deadlines:** System shows administrative due dates, not actual lab deadlines
3. **Poor Quality Control:** Can't easily trace problems across related samples
4. **Rush Sample Chaos:** Everything shows the same deadline, making priorities unclear
5. **Workflow Confusion:** Can't tell the difference between initial tests and repeat tests
6. **No Sample Ownership:** Can't tell who is responsible for samples in progress
7. **Customer Context Lost:** Can't easily see customer-level workload or provide status updates
8. **No Early Warning:** Can't predict upcoming chemistry workload from DPM Early Start samples

### Her Success Criteria
If LIMS6000 works well, Dr. Chen should be able to:
- See all her work priorities in one place, organized by customer and order
- Understand real deadlines that matter to her workflow
- Quickly review test batches for quality control
- Identify and resolve testing problems efficiently
- Know who is responsible for each sample at any given time
- Provide customer-level status updates quickly
- Anticipate upcoming workload from DPM Early Start samples 2-3 days in advance

## üñ•Ô∏è What We Built: Welcome Dashboard

### The Prototype Explained

## üîÑ Key Workflow Innovations

### Customer-First Organization System
**Core Principle:** All information organizes around the natural laboratory communication hierarchy of Customer ‚Üí Customer Order ‚Üí Individual Samples.

**How It Works:**
- Default Order View groups samples by customer orders
- Multiple orders per customer are clearly distinguished
- Customer-level priority and status aggregation
- External reporting deadlines take absolute priority
- Supports natural customer communication patterns

### Sample Checkout System
**Core Principle:** Samples are "checked out" by qualified users, reflecting real-world operations where team members take responsibility for timely processing.

**How It Works:**
- Users with qualifying Demonstrations of Capability (DoCs) can "check out" samples
- Checked out samples show clear ownership and responsibility
- Status progression: Ready for Prep ‚Üí Prep (checked out) ‚Üí Prepped ‚Üí Analysis (checked out) ‚Üí Analyzed
- Ensures samples are processed to meet ReportingNeededBy deadlines

### DPM Early Start Logic with Customer Aggregation
**Early Warning Chemistry:** Provides advance notice of potential chemistry workload organized by customer:
1. **Customer-Level Aggregation:** Shows total potential samples per customer that could require chemistry
2. **ES Due Dates:** "Early Start Due" indicates when microbial decisions are expected
3. **Expandable Detail:** Click customer to see constituent orders and individual sample progress
4. **Priority Inheritance:** Customer-level priority based on highest priority constituent sample

**Prerequisites for Chemistry Assignment:**
1. **Passing ALL microbial assays:** Bile-Tolerant Gram Negative Bacteria, Total Yeast & Mold, Total Aerobic Bacteria, STEC, Salmonella, Total Coliforms
2. **Completing microbial primary review:** Marked as complete
3. **Completing microbial secondary review:** Marked as complete

**Result:** Qualified samples automatically have required chemistry tests added and appear in analysts' pipelines as "Ready for Prep"

### Workflow Status Granularity
**Enhanced Status Tracking:**
- **Ready for Prep:** Available for checkout by prep team
- **Prep:** Checked out by prep team member (shows who)
- **Prepped:** Prep complete, ready for analysis checkout
- **Analysis:** Checked out by qualified analyst (shows who)
- **Analyzed:** Analysis complete, ready for review
- **Primary Review:** Awaiting primary reviewer
- **Secondary Review:** Awaiting secondary reviewer

- **Fragmented Data:** Information scattered across multiple systems
- **Unclear Ownership:** No way to know who is responsible for samples
- **Customer-Order Disconnection:** No clear customer communication context
- **No Early Warning:** No advance notice of upcoming workload

### What We Prioritized
- **Single Source of Truth:** All information in one place
- **Real Deadlines:** Dates that matter to laboratory workflow with reporting priority
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Important information stands out
- **Fast Navigation:** Common tasks require minimal clicks
- **Modern Appearance:** Professional, clean design
- **Clear Ownership:** Sample checkout system with accountability
