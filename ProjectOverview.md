# LIMS6000 Phase 1 Implementation Status

**Document Purpose:** Complete development record for a prototype web application replacing an outdated laboratory management system. This document assumes no prior knowledge of the project.

**Last Updated:** May 30, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/adamscavone/LIMS6KCustomerJourney  
**Local Path:** `c:\000repo\LIMS6KCustomerJourney`

## üìã Project Background

### What is LIMS?
**LIMS** (Laboratory Information Management System) is software that manages laboratory samples, test results, and workflows. Think of it as the central nervous system for a scientific testing lab.

### The Business Problem
Our cannabis testing laboratory currently uses **LIMS5000**, an outdated system that creates significant productivity problems:
- Scientists spend hours hunting for information across multiple systems
- Critical sample prep data lives in Excel spreadsheets outside the main system
- Due dates are misleading and don't reflect actual laboratory deadlines
- The user interface is confusing and slow

### The Solution
Build **LIMS6000** - a modern, web-based replacement focused on how scientists actually work.

## üéØ Phase 1 Objective

**Goal:** Create a working prototype of the main dashboard that laboratory scientists use daily.

**Why start here:** This dashboard is where scientists spend most of their time planning work, reviewing test results, and managing priorities. Getting this right is critical for user adoption.

**Deliverable:** A functional web application that stakeholders can use in a browser to experience the new workflow.

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Primary User: Dr. Sarah Chen

### Who She Is
- **Role:** Senior Chemistry Analyst
- **Experience:** 8 years in cannabis testing laboratories
- **Education:** B.S. in Chemistry, specialized certifications
- **Personality:** Detail-oriented, scientifically rigorous, frustrated by inefficient systems

### What She Does Daily
- **Morning:** Plans daily work by reviewing samples that need testing
- **Day:** Runs chemical analyses on cannabis samples (cannabinoids, terpenes, pesticides)
- **Evening:** Loads instruments for overnight testing runs
- **Next Morning:** Reviews overnight test results and makes quality control decisions

### Her Current Pain Points (Why She Hates LIMS5000)
1. **Information Scattered:** Critical data is split between LIMS and Excel files
2. **Confusing Deadlines:** System shows administrative due dates, not actual lab deadlines
3. **Poor Quality Control:** Can't easily trace problems across related samples
4. **Rush Sample Chaos:** Everything shows the same deadline, making priorities unclear
5. **Workflow Confusion:** Can't tell the difference between initial tests and repeat tests

### Her Success Criteria
If LIMS6000 works well, Dr. Chen should be able to:
- See all her work priorities in one place
- Understand real deadlines that matter to her workflow
- Quickly review test batches for quality control
- Identify and resolve testing problems efficiently

## üñ•Ô∏è What We Built: Senior Chemist Dashboard

### The Prototype Explained
We created a web application (like a webpage) that shows Dr. Chen's daily work in an organized, easy-to-use interface.

### Main Features

**1. Sample Pipeline (Left Side of Screen):**
- **Tabs for Different Tests:** Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Pesticides/Mycotoxins
- **Smart Sorting:** Shows overdue samples first, then today's work, then future work
- **Clear Priorities:** Rush samples are clearly marked in red
- **Real Deadlines:** Shows when prep is due, when analysis is due, and when reports are due

**2. Batch Review Section (Right Side of Screen):**
- **Completed Test Batches:** Groups of samples that were tested together
- **Quality Control Status:** Green checkmarks for good results, red X for problems
- **One-Click Actions:** Easy buttons to review results or view quality control charts

**3. Daily Overview:**
- **Key Numbers:** How many samples are overdue, due today, need review
- **Quick Stats:** Shows problems that need immediate attention

### Visual Design Principles
- **Clean and Modern:** No cluttered interface like LIMS5000
- **Flat Design:** Information is easy to scan without excessive nesting
- **Color-Coded Urgency:** Red for overdue, orange for today, gray for future
- **Minimal Clicks:** Common actions are easy to find and use

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
**Frontend (What Users See):**
- **React:** Modern web application framework
- **Tailwind CSS:** Modern styling framework for clean appearance
- **Lucide React:** Professional icons

**Backend (Data and Logic):**
- **Mock Data:** Fake but realistic sample data for testing
- **Future:** Will connect to Azure SQL database with real laboratory data

**Hosting:**
- **Azure Static Web Apps:** Microsoft's cloud hosting service
- **Automatic Deployment:** When code changes are pushed to GitHub, the website automatically updates

## üö® Critical Design Decisions

### What We Avoided (LIMS5000 Problems)
- **Telerik Controls:** Old-fashioned interface components
- **Nested Menus:** Information buried multiple clicks deep
- **Times New Roman Font:** Outdated typography
- **Misleading Dates:** Administrative deadlines instead of lab deadlines
- **Fragmented Data:** Information scattered across multiple systems

### What We Prioritized
- **Single Source of Truth:** All information in one place
- **Real Deadlines:** Dates that matter to laboratory workflow
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Important information stands out
- **Fast Navigation:** Common tasks require minimal clicks
- **Modern Appearance:** Professional, clean design
