# LIMS Safeguards and Failsafes Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the critical safeguards and failsafe mechanisms implemented throughout the LIMS to ensure data integrity, maintain regulatory compliance, and prevent operational errors.

For specific edge cases and their handling, see the companion document: LIMS_Edge_Cases.md

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Safeguards
- **Automatic sample checkout** when adding to batches
- **Single analyst per batch** enforcement (mock user: Dr. Sarah Chen)
- **Pipeline-specific view modes** preventing global state conflicts
- **Return samples workflow** for partial batch completion
- **Multi-select patterns** using OS-native conventions (Ctrl+Click, Shift+Click)
- **Analysis batch creation** combining multiple prep batches
- **Air gap handling** with instrument selection and manual file upload
- **Checkbox selection fix** in Pending Analysis section
- **Mock data consistency** ensuring statuses match UI headers

### ‚è≥ Pending Implementation
- Equipment tracking with calibration validation
- Supervisor override system with reason logging
- Comprehensive audit trail
- QC sample requirements per batch
- Batch size limits with warnings
- Electronic signatures
- Real-time collaboration locks

## Preparation Batch Management Safeguards

### 1. Batch Status Workflow

#### States and Transitions
- **Open (In Progress)**: Samples can be added, batch is actively being prepared
- **Ready for Analysis (Locked)**: No further samples can be added, batch is complete
- **Override Required**: Special circumstances requiring supervisor approval

#### Business Rules
1. **Single Analyst Requirement**: Each batch must maintain analytical integrity
   - All samples in a batch MUST be prepared by the same analyst
   - Using the same equipment set
   - Following the same SOP
   - At approximately the same time
   - This ensures consistency and traceability

2. **Batch Locking**: Once marked "Ready for Analysis", a batch becomes read-only
   - No samples can be added
   - Equipment list is frozen
   - Analyst information cannot be changed
   - Timestamp is recorded for audit trail
   - All samples remaining in batch when marked ready are certified as prepared by that analyst

3. **Sample Check-out/Check-in**
   - Automatic checkout occurs when samples are added to a batch
   - No explicit "check out" step required - happens transparently
   - Check-out records: who, when, batch assignment
   - Prevents double-booking of samples (locked from other users)
   - Creates audit trail for sample custody
   - "Return Samples" feature for partial batch completion scenarios

4. **Return Samples Workflow**
   - Used when samples cannot be prepared due to interruption
   - Maintains data integrity by ensuring LIMS reflects reality
   - Selected samples are returned to available pool
   - Returned samples were NOT prepared by the batch analyst
   - Remaining samples in batch WERE prepared by the batch analyst
   - "Mark Ready" disabled when samples selected to prevent confusion

### 2. Equipment Tracking Safeguards

#### Calibration Status
- Equipment with expired calibration dates are flagged
- Warning displayed when adding equipment nearing calibration due date
- Supervisor override required for equipment past calibration

#### Serial Number Validation
- Duplicate serial numbers prevented within same batch
- Equipment usage history tracked across batches
- Maintenance records linked to equipment serial numbers

### 3. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Compliance

#### Version Control
- Only current SOP versions available for selection
- Legacy SOPs marked clearly if still in use
- Automatic notification when SOP updates available

#### Training Verification
- Analyst must be trained on selected SOP
- System validates analyst certification status
- Override mechanism for emergency situations with documentation

### 4. Data Entry Safeguards

#### Multi-Select Controls
- Windows-native selection patterns (Ctrl+Click, Shift+Click)
- Visual feedback for selected items
- Confirmation required before bulk operations

#### Accidental Modification Prevention
- Locked batches require supervisor credentials to modify
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Undo capability for recent actions (within session)

### 5. Failsafe Mechanisms

#### Supervisor Override System
All locked states can be overridden with proper authorization:
- Requires supervisor credentials
- Reason for override must be documented
- Creates permanent audit log entry
- Notifications sent to quality assurance team

#### Emergency Sample Addition
For rush/emergency samples to locked batches:
1. Supervisor approval required
2. Reason must be selected from predefined list:
   - Customer emergency
   - Regulatory requirement
   - Instrument failure recovery
   - Quality control failure
3. Additional documentation may be required
4. Sample flagged as "Exception" in batch

#### Data Recovery
- All actions logged with timestamps
- Soft delete for all records (no hard deletes)
- Daily backups of all batch data
- Version history maintained for all edits

### 6. Workflow Safeguards

#### Timing Verification
- System tracks elapsed time between sample check-out and batch creation
- Warnings issued if time exceeds SOP limits
- Automatic email notifications for overdue checked-out samples

#### Concurrent User Protection
- Pessimistic locking when editing batches
- Real-time updates when multiple users viewing same data
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

### 7. Quality Control Integration

#### QC Sample Requirements
- Minimum QC samples required per batch size
- Automatic prompts for QC insertion
- Cannot mark batch "Ready" without required QC samples

#### Batch Size Limits
- Maximum samples per batch defined by SOP
- Warning at 80% capacity
- Hard stop at 100% capacity (override available)

## Implementation Notes

### User Interface Indicators
- üîí Lock icon for locked/read-only states
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning triangle for items requiring attention
- ‚úì Checkmark for validated/approved items
- üîÑ Refresh icon for items requiring sync

### Audit Trail Requirements
Every safeguard interaction must record:
- User ID and name
- Timestamp (server time)
- Action taken
- Previous value (if modification)
- New value (if modification)
- Reason/justification (if override)

### Future Enhancements
1. Integration with instrument software for automatic result import
2. Barcode scanning for sample identification
3. Electronic signatures for batch approval
4. Automated equipment calibration reminders
5. Mobile app for sample check-out in the field

## Regulatory Compliance

These safeguards support compliance with:
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 (Electronic Records)
- ISO/IEC 17025 (Testing Laboratory Competence)
- Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines
- State cannabis testing regulations

## Training Requirements

All users must be trained on:
1. Proper use of safeguard features
2. When and how to request overrides
3. Documentation requirements
4. Audit trail implications
5. Emergency procedures
