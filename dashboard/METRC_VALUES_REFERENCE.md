## Notes

1. Test Categories determine which analytes must be reported to Metrc
2. Item Categories represent the physical form of the cannabis product
3. Assays are the actual laboratory tests performed on samples
4. Some Test Categories are compliance-required while others are voluntary
5. DPM (Dispensary Plant Material) is the most common test category for flower samples
6. Voluntary Testing categories allow for additional testing beyond compliance requirements
