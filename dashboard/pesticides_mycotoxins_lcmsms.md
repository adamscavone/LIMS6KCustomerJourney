## 1. Scope and Application
This SOP defines procedures for determining pesticide and mycotoxin levels in medical marijuana products using LCMSMS. Analysts must be trained and proficient. Analytes include:

**Pesticides**: Abamectin, Aldicarb, Bifenazate, Cyfluthrin, Daminozide, Diazinon, Dichlorvos, Dimethoate, Etoxazole, Flonicamid, Fludioxonil, Imidacloprid, Myclobutanil, Paclobutrazol, Piperonyl Butoxide, Pyrethrin I, Spinosad, Spirotetramat, Thiamethoxam, Trifloxystrobin.

**Mycotoxins**: Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, Ochratoxin A.

---

## 2. Definitions
Key terminology includes SOP, LOD, LOQ, LCS, MS/MSD, ICV, CCV, and related QC metrics.

---

## 3. Health and Safety
- Always wear lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
- Handle toxic analytes (e.g., myclobutanil, piperonyl butoxide) under a fume hood.
- Follow SDS for all chemicals.
- Never clean instruments with alcohol.

---

## 4. Equipment
Key equipment includes Shimadzu LCMS-8060, Nexera XR Pumps, autosampler, column oven, vacuum pump, Geno Grinder, sonicating bath, and appropriate vials, filters, and columns.

---

## 5. Reagents and Standards
- Solvents: Methanol, acetonitrile, ammonium formate, formic acid, Type 1 water (all LCMS-grade).
- Standards sourced from Accustandard and Sigma Aldrich.

---

## 6. Reagent and Standard Prep
- Mobile phases A and B prepared fresh or as needed.
- Calibration standards prepared from 500 ppb down to 0.5 ppb.
- Store standards in freezer; most stable for 1 month.
- Use pooled non-detect flower matrix as matrix base.

---

## 7. Sample Storage
- Store samples at room temperature in secure vault.
- Homogenize samples on receipt; draw all aliquots from composite sample.

---

## 8. Calibration
- Minimum 5-point calibration with r² ≥ 0.990.
- Include ICV, CCV, and CCB during each run.

---

## 9. Quality Control
- Acceptable recovery limits: ICV (±40%), CCV (±30%), LOQ spikes (±50% with RSD ≤ 20%), LCS and MS/MSD within lab-established ranges.
- Include at least one LCB, LCS, and MS/MSD per 26 samples.
- Analysts must complete IDC (initial) and DOC (annual).

## 10. Procedure

### Sample Preparation
- **Flower**: 0.5 g + 5 mL acetonitrile, spike, sonicate, vortex, filter.
- **Sugars**: 0.5 g + 1 mL water + 5 mL acetonitrile, dissolve, centrifuge, filter.
- **Oils/Waxes**: 0.5 g + 5 mL acetonitrile + 2 mL hexane, vortex, filter.
- **Isolates**: 0.5 g + 5 mL acetonitrile, filter.

### Instrument Setup
- Power on and purge system.
- Warm-up: 30 min.
- Start LCMS, load method, verify temperatures and pressures.

### Shutdown
- Flush column, turn off pumps, shut down software.

### Data Handling
- Review chromatograms and QC criteria.
- Export data via Shimadzu Data Exporter.
- Validate using DOC-99-01 spreadsheet.

## 11. Calculations
- **% Recovery** = [(A - B)/T] * 100
- **Standard Deviation**, **RPD**, and conversion to ppm from raw instrument data.
- **Spinosad**: Sum of Spinosyn A + D.

---

## 12. Waste Management
Dispose of chemical and sample waste per laboratory procedure.

---

## 13. References
Includes Massachusetts QA guidelines, Shimadzu manuals, EPA SW-846, etc.

---

## 14. Revision History
Tracks changes across revisions 01–04, including equipment updates, procedural clarifications, and QC revisions.

---

## 15. Appendices
- Maintenance schedules (vacuum pump, LC cleaning, lens system).
- Troubleshooting (refer to instrument manual).
- Method parameters (not detailed here).
