# Deployment Options for LIMS Dashboard

Since I cannot directly deploy your application, here are several options you can use to get your app running with a public URL:

## Option 1: Vercel (Easiest & Free)

Vercel offers the simplest deployment for React apps with automatic HTTPS and great performance.

### Steps:
1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. From your dashboard directory, run:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Login/create account
   - Confirm project settings
   - Deploy

Your app will be live at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Option 2: Netlify (Also Easy & Free)

### Method A: Drag & Drop
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
3. Drag your `build` folder onto the page
4. Get instant URL

### Method B: CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --dir=build --prod
```

## Option 3: GitHub Pages (Free with GitHub)

1. Install gh-pages:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. Add to package.json:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
   "scripts": {
     ...existing scripts,
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Option 4: Surge.sh (Simple & Free)

1. Install and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm install -g surge
   npm run build
   cd build
   surge
   ```

2. Choose a domain or use the generated one

## Option 5: Local Tunnel (Temporary URL)

For quick sharing without deployment:

### Using ngrok:
```bash
npm start  # In one terminal
ngrok http 3000  # In another terminal
```

### Using localtunnel:
```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
npm start
lt --port 3000
```

## Option 6: Railway (Simple with Database Support)

1. Install Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

## Recommended: Vercel

For your use case, I recommend Vercel because:
- Zero configuration needed

- Easy custom domain setup
- Automatic deployments from Git

Just run `npx vercel` from your dashboard directory and follow the prompts!
