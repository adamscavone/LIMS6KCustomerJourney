### 3. Data Integrity Enforcement
- **No Null Values Policy** implemented across all components:
  - Bench sheets require all fields to be filled (use N/A when not applicable)
  - Review comments must be filled (N/A if no comments)
  - Equipment fields can be set to "N/A - Not Used" when not utilized
- **"Fill Empty with N/A" buttons** added to:
  - Bench Sheet component
  - Review Queue component
  - Speeds up data entry while maintaining compliance

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Mobile-First Design**:

  - Responsive grid layouts using Tailwind's lg: breakpoint
  - Equipment and reagents reposition based on screen size
- **Navigation Enhancements**:
  - Added "Review Queue" button to "Secondary Review Complete" section
  - Direct navigation from prep batch to bench sheet
  - Consistent navigation patterns across all workflows

### 5. Product Type Management
- Comprehensive list of 50+ product types including:
  - Traditional forms: Flower, Kief, Hash
  - Concentrates: Badder, Budder, Shatter, Diamonds, Distillate
  - Edibles: Brownies, Cookies, Gummies, Chocolate, Beverages
  - Topicals: Balm, Lotion, Massage Oil, Muscle Spray
  - Tinctures and oils
  - Vape products
- Product type required for all actual samples (not QC samples)

### Routing Updates
```javascript
<Route path="/review-queue/:assayType" element={<ReviewQueue />} />
<Route path="/bench-sheet/:prepBatchId" element={<BenchSheet />} />
```

### Key Validation Rules
1. **Bench Sheet**:
   - `sampleWeight`: Cannot be negative, required except for LCB
   - `extractionVolume`: Cannot be negative, always required
   - `productType`: Required for non-QC samples
   - `comments`: Required (can be "N/A")

2. **Review Queue**:
   - All manual checks must be completed
   - Review decision (Accept/Reject) required
   - Comments can be filled with N/A but not left empty

## Documentation Updates
1. **CLAUDE.md**: Added sections on recent design decisions and component descriptions
2. **LIMS_Critical_Understandings.md**: Enhanced data integrity rules section
3. **BENCH_SHEET_GUIDE.md**: New comprehensive guide for bench sheet functionality
4. **readme.md**: Updated with new routes and business rules

### 6. Metrc Receiving Dashboard Implementation (Updated January 2025)
- **Route**: `/receiving`
- **Title**: Changed from "Sample Receiving Dashboard" to "Metrc Receiving"
- **Key Features**:
  - **Decluttered Interface**: 
    - Removed driver ETA containers completely
    - Removed "Inbound Manifests" header
    - Consolidated header with smaller padding and more compact controls
    - Single toggle behavior - caret only opens receiving interface (no alternate views)
  - **Enhanced Table Structure**:
    - Added "Source Package" column with mock Metrc package tags
    - Added "Item Category" column with proper Metrc categories (Buds, Pre-Roll, Edibles, etc.)
    - Fixed column consistency between expanded and collapsed states
    - Corrected data mapping issues (categories no longer show weights)
  - **Simplified Tooltip Implementation**:
    - Removed complex Micro Due tooltip due to z-index issues
    - Added simple native HTML title tooltip: "This is a tooltip."
    - Removed AlertCircle icons from individual rows
  - **Functional Manifest Expansion**: Click spindown arrow next to client name to open receiving interface
  - **CC Order ID Display**: Shows at same level as Manifest Number when receiving
  - **Expand All Samples**: One-click expansion of all sample details
  - **Comprehensive Assay Selection**:
    - Chemistry panel: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Pesticides, Mycotoxins, Heavy Metals, Elemental Analysis, Total Nitrogen, Total Sulfur, Residual Solvents
    - Microbial panel: Salmonella, STEC, Total Aerobic Bacteria, Total Coliforms, Total Yeast & Mold, BTGN
    - Other tests: Plant Pathogens, Plant Sex, Foreign Matter, Moisture Content, Water Activity
  - **Potency Target Management**:
    - Default analyte: Total THC (highest priority)
    - Full cannabinoid panel: Total THC, CBD, CBC, CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBGa, CBN, delta8-THC, delta9-THC, THCa, THCV, THCVa
    - Default Units (mg/g or %) on same row as Potency Targets header
  - **Sample Weights/Qtys**: Side-by-side container with Potency Targets
    - Supports "each" as unit for individual items
    - Compact layout with abbreviated labels
  - **Manifest-Level Actions**:
    - "Rush All" button to apply rush status to all samples
    - "DPM Early Start All" button for batch DPM early start assignment
  - **Test Category Support**: Full Ohio compliance test categories
  - **Smart Micro Due Date Calculation**:
    - Individual turnaround time tracking for each microbial assay
    - PCR methods (Salmonella) have 24-hour faster turnaround than culture-based methods
    - Displays latest (most conservative) due date to ensure all tests can complete
    - Automatically recalculates when test category or selected assays change
    - Default assays pre-selected based on test category (e.g., all micro tests for DPM)
  - **Due Date Pickers**: Native HTML5 datetime-local inputs for both Micro Due and Chemistry Due fields

### 7. Sampling Dashboard Driver Display Redesign
- **Route**: `/sampling`
- **Key Changes**:
  - **Replaced Individual Driver Containers**: Removed grid of 3-column driver cards
  - **New Compact Table View**:

    - "View Route" button expands detailed timeline below table
  - **Route Details on Demand**:
    - Expandable route timeline shows departure → stops → return
    - Visual timeline with connecting lines between stops
    - Inline unassign buttons for each stop
  - **Summary Statistics Bar**:
    - Active Drivers count
    - Total Stops assigned
    - Unassigned stops
    - Average stops per driver
  - **Scalability**: Handles 9+ drivers and 14+ stops without overwhelming interface
