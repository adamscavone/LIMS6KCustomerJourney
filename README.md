# Customer Profile: Laboratory Chemistry Analyst

## User Persona: Dr. Sarah Chen, Senior Chemistry Analyst

**Background:**
Sarah is a 32-year-old analytical chemist with 8 years of experience in cannabis testing laboratories. She holds a B.S. in Chemistry and has specialized certifications in chromatography and mass spectrometry. She's detail-oriented, scientifically rigorous, and deeply frustrated by systems that create unnecessary complexity in her analytical workflow.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Conducting primary and secondary reviews of analytical batches
- Managing multiple assays simultaneously (cannabinoids, pesticides, terpenes, heavy metals)
- Ensuring QC compliance and data integrity
- Meeting strict turnaround time requirements
- Maintaining Demonstrations of Capability (DoCs) across multiple assays

## Pain Points with Current System (LIMS5000)

**Critical Frustrations:**
1. **Fragmented Information Architecture:** Critical sample prep data lives in Excel workbooks outside LIMS, making comprehensive batch review nearly impossible
2. **Misleading Time Management:** "NeededBy" dates don't reflect her actual analytical deadlines - she has to mentally calculate backwards from reporting deadlines
3. **Poor Batch Traceability:** Cannot easily trace sample results within batches or investigate quality control failures across related samples
4. **Rush Sample Chaos:** The rush flagging system is broken, causing all samples to show the same misleading due date
5. **Confirmation Workflow Blindness:** No clear visual distinction between initial analysis and confirmation runs, leading to workflow confusion

## Ideal User Journey for LIMS6000

### **Morning Workflow: Daily Planning & Prioritization**

Sarah logs in and immediately sees a **unified dashboard** that shows:
- **Intelligent Due Date Hierarchy:** Clear visual distinction between "prep due," "analysis due," and "reporting due" with color-coded urgency
- **Personal Workload Overview:** All samples awaiting her review, filtered by her specific DoCs, with realistic time estimates
- **Batch Status Pipeline:** Visual workflow showing samples moving through prep → analysis → primary review → secondary review
- **Priority Alerts:** Rush samples clearly flagged with actual analytical deadlines (not misleading system dates)

### **Primary Review Workflow: Comprehensive Batch Analysis**

When Sarah clicks into a batch for primary review:
- **Integrated Batch Record:** All sample prep data, QC results, and instrument parameters in one unified view (no more Excel hunting)
- **Smart Quality Control Dashboard:** Automated QC evaluation with clear pass/fail indicators and deviation flagging
- **Traceability Tools:** One-click access to equipment records, calibration data, and analyst qualifications for the entire batch
- **Exception Management:** Streamlined interface for documenting deviations with pre-populated templates and approval workflows

### **Secondary Review Workflow: Cross-Verification**

For secondary review of colleagues' work:
- **Comparative Analysis View:** Side-by-side comparison of QC data, calculations, and reviewer notes
- **Deviation Investigation Tools:** Easy access to batch-level quality controls to investigate potential systematic errors
- **Collaborative Annotation:** Ability to add notes and questions that integrate with the primary reviewer's workflow
- **Escalation Pathways:** Clear workflows for declining approval with structured feedback loops

### **Confirmation Analysis Management**

When handling confirmation requests:
- **Confirmation Tracking Dashboard:** Clear visual distinction between initial and confirmatory analyses
- **Replicate Management:** Intuitive interface for managing different replicate requirements (duplicate, triplicate, etc.)
- **Timeline Coordination:** Realistic deadline calculation that accounts for confirmation complexity
- **Customer Communication Integration:** Automated notifications to customer service team about confirmation status

### **Multi-Assay Coordination**

Throughout her day, Sarah needs seamless coordination across her DoC-qualified assays:
- **Cross-Assay Sample Tracking:** Unified view of sample progress across all assays (cannabinoids, pesticides, etc.)
- **Bottleneck Identification:** Visual indicators of workflow bottlenecks across all assays she's qualified for
- **Intelligent Task Routing:** System suggestions for optimal task sequencing based on deadlines and equipment availability
- **Capacity Planning:** Real-time workload distribution across qualified analysts

## Key Design Principles for LIMS6000

### **Information Architecture:**
- **Single Source of Truth:** All analytical data, QC records, and sample prep information unified in one system
- **Context-Aware Navigation:** Information presented based on user's DoCs and current workflow stage
- **Intelligent Filtering:** Smart defaults that show relevant information without overwhelming detail

### **Workflow Optimization:**
- **Realistic Time Management:** Due dates that reflect actual analytical requirements, not administrative deadlines
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Essential information prominent, detailed data accessible with minimal clicks
- **Error Prevention:** Built-in validation and confirmation steps for critical decisions

### **Quality Control Integration:**
- **Automated Compliance Checking:** System automatically validates QC requirements and flags deviations
- **Audit Trail Transparency:** Complete traceability of all analytical decisions and data modifications
- **Collaborative Review Tools:** Seamless handoff between primary and secondary reviewers

## Success Metrics

Sarah's ideal day with LIMS6000:
- **Reduced Context Switching:** 80% reduction in time spent hunting for sample prep data across multiple systems
- **Improved Decision Speed:** 50% faster batch review completion through integrated QC dashboards
- **Enhanced Quality Assurance:** Zero missed QC failures due to improved batch-level visibility
- **Stress Reduction:** Confidence in deadline management through realistic, role-specific due dates
- **Proactive Problem Solving:** Early identification of systematic issues through improved traceability tools

This customer profile emphasizes that Sarah is not just processing samples - she's maintaining the scientific integrity of the entire analytical operation while managing complex time pressures and regulatory requirements. LIMS6000 must support her as both a individual contributor and a critical quality assurance checkpoint in the laboratory's compliance framework.
