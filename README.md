# Customer Profile: Laboratory Chemistry Analyst

## User Persona: Dr. Sarah Chen, Senior Chemistry Analyst

**Background:**
Sarah is a 32-year-old analytical chemist with 8 years of experience in cannabis testing laboratories. She holds a B.S. in Chemistry and has specialized certifications in chromatography and mass spectrometry. She's detail-oriented, scientifically rigorous, and deeply frustrated by systems that create unnecessary complexity in her analytical workflow. She frequently communicates with customer service teams about order status and sample progress.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Conducting primary and secondary reviews of analytical batches
- Managing multiple assays simultaneously (cannabinoids, pesticides, terpenes, heavy metals)
- Ensuring QC compliance and data integrity
- Meeting strict turnaround time requirements with reporting deadlines as highest priority
- Maintaining Demonstrations of Capability (DoCs) across multiple assays
- **Customer workload management** for capacity planning and communication
- **Multi-order coordination** for customers with multiple concurrent orders
- **Customer status communication** providing updates organized by customer and order context
- **Analytical batch planning** organizing prep batches and instrument run schedules
- **Air gap data management** handling manual export/import cycles between instruments and LIMS
- **Phase-based workflow coordination** managing different types of work across samples in various processing stages

## Pain Points with Current System (LIMS5000)

**Critical Frustrations:**
1. **Fragmented Information Architecture:** Critical sample prep data lives in Excel workbooks outside LIMS, making comprehensive batch review nearly impossible
2. **Misleading Time Management:** "NeededBy" dates don't reflect her actual analytical deadlines - she has to mentally calculate backwards from reporting deadlines
3. **Poor Batch Traceability:** Cannot easily trace sample results within batches or investigate quality control failures across related samples
4. **Rush Sample Chaos:** The rush flagging system is broken, causing all samples to show the same misleading due date
5. **Confirmation Workflow Blindness:** No clear visual distinction between initial analysis and confirmation runs, leading to workflow confusion
6. **Customer Context Lost:** Cannot easily see customer-level workload or provide coherent status updates organized by customer and order
7. **No Early Warning System:** Cannot predict upcoming chemistry workload from DPM Early Start samples, making resource planning difficult
8. **Multi-Order Confusion:** Customers with multiple orders are difficult to track and communicate about effectively
9. **Mixed Workflow Phases:** All samples jumbled together regardless of what type of work is needed, causing confusion about required actions
10. **No Analytical Batch Visibility:** Cannot see instrument run organization or track complex multi-batch analytical processes
11. **Air Gap Confusion:** No clear guidance for when and how to export data from instruments to LIMS
12. **Content Shifting:** Information moves around in tabular displays making it difficult to scan efficiently
